# Synthetic code-task image

This directory is one complete `axrun.synthetic.code-task@1` fixture. Its task seed is the OCI image built by the adjacent `Dockerfile`; Axrun does not reconstruct `/workspace` by uploading dataset files at Run time.

The image owns:

- Python 3 and Git;
- the repository at `/workspace`;
- the clean base commit declared by `row.json`.
- the repository's own `.gitignore`, including Python bytecode and cache exclusions.

Workspace ignore policy belongs to the immutable task seed. Harnesses continue to export every tracked or untracked change recognized by Git and do not embed language- or benchmark-specific artifact filters.

Build the task image for the target Axern node. The mirror arguments are optional build-time transport choices and are not embedded as private infrastructure defaults:

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 --load \
  -t axrun-synthetic-code-task:1 \
  fixtures/synthetic/code-task-v1
```

For a CLI-managed local Axern node, import it with `axern local image load axrun-synthetic-code-task:1`. During joint development against Axern's source-managed Compose stack, use that checkout's source import path instead:

```bash
IMAGE=axrun-synthetic-code-task:1 make -C /path/to/axern local-compose-image-import
```

Create the Axern Environment from the canonical digest returned by the import, not from an unpinned mutable tag.

The Dockerfile supports `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`; publish a multi-platform index or import the matching single-platform build. Both inference and verification Environments must be created from the imported or registry-resolved digest of this same image. Each stage still gets a fresh Run and Allocation. Claude Code is not installed in this task image; its independently built rootfs is attached read-only at `/__claude_code` only for the Claude inference Run.

The deterministic gold and known-bad paths run on either supported task-image platform. Claude Code `2.1.205` remains a separate mount with matching `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` rootfs variants. Production and benchmark acceptance use amd64; arm64 is available for local source-cluster development. The task image, Claude rootfs, and Axern node must use the same platform.
